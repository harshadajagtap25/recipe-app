# 🥦 FridgeRecipe App


## 🧭 Overview
- FridgeRecipe is a web application that helps you make the most of your refrigerator inventory. By tracking what's in your fridge, the app suggests recipes that match your available ingredients, reducing food waste and simplifying meal planning.


## ✨ Features
- Fridge Inventory Management: Add and remove items from your virtual fridge
- Smart Recipe Suggestions: Get top 3 recipe recommendations based on ingredients you already have
- Recipe Details: View comprehensive information for each recipe:
    - Step-by-step cooking instructions
    - Preparation and cooking times
    - Serving size
    - Category (lunch/dinner, snack, dessert)
    - Visual reference with recipe images
    - Ingredient requirements with availability status


## ⚙️ How It Works
- Manage your fridge inventory by adding items from a curated list
- The system automatically identifies recipes that match your available ingredients
- Recipe matching algorithm prioritizes ingredients that require refrigeration
- Common pantry staples (salt, sugar, spices) are assumed to be available and not tracked
